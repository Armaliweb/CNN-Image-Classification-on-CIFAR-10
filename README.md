# CNN-Image-Classification-on-CIFAR-10
This project explores Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. Implemented as part of the CSC 4301 â€“ Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course, the project investigates multiple CNN architectures, experiments with hyperparameters, and evaluates model performance on training and test sets.
