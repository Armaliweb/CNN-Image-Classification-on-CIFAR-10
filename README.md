# CNN Image Classification on CIFAR-10

This repository contains the implementation and report for **Project #4 ‚Äì CNN Image Classification**, part of the CSC 4301 *Introduction to Artificial Intelligence* course (Spring 2024).

---

## Overview
The goal of this project is to train **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to classify images from the **CIFAR-10 dataset** (60,000 32√ó32 color images across 10 classes).  
We experimented with multiple architectures and hyperparameters to improve performance and studied how machines "learn to see" the world.

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation
We built three different CNN models:
1. **Model 1** ‚Äì Baseline CNN with convolution, pooling, and dense layers.  
2. **Model 2** ‚Äì Improved CNN with more filters, batch normalization, and dropout.  
3. **Model 3** ‚Äì Deeper CNN with regularization and larger convolution blocks.  

Hyperparameters explored:
- Learning Rate
- Dropout Rate
- Optimizer (Adam, RMSprop, SGD, etc.)
- Batch Size

---

##  Results
- Best performing model: **Model 2**  
- Training accuracy: ~65%  
- Test accuracy: ~43%  
- Extensive experiments showed that optimal hyperparameters **individually** do not always combine into the best collective performance.
